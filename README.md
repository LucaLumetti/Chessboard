This is the repository of my project I will bring at my graduation exam in  2017 at A. Volta Sassuolo.
It's a physical chessboard made of wood, the various pieces have attached to the base a small neodymium magnet, under the board, connected to Raspberry and some integrated circuits (MUX and MCP) there are 64 Reed Switch that "trace" the movement of the pieces. Through stockfish and LEDs placed in each square, based on each user move, the computer indicates the moves in response. The user will be required to physically move move because my Raspberry Pi doesn't have hands or arms.
